\# 🧩 PDF Converter (Offline)



I have trust issues uploading private documents to online PDF converters —  

so I made my own \*\*offline\*\* one instead. 😌  



A simple desktop app built with \*\*Python\*\* and \*\*CustomTkinter\*\*  

to combine multiple PDF files into a single file — locally, securely, and fast.

\- 🧹 Automatically clear the file list after combining  

\- 🖥️ Modern GUI (minimize, maximize, close)  

\- 💾 Runs fully \*\*offline\*\* — no data ever leaves your device

\## ⚙️ How to Use

1\. Run the `.exe` file in the `dist` folder  

2\. Click \*\*Select PDFs\*\* → choose multiple PDF files  

3\. Click \*\*Combine PDFs\*\* → select where to save

\## 💡 Why Offline?

Because not everything should be uploaded to a random website 😅  

This tool keeps your PDFs safe, private, and processed directly on your own PC.
